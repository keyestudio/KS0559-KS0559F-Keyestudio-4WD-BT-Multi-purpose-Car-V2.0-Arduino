**4.Wiring Diagram**

![image-20250508161123490](media/8.png)

As can be seen from the above figure, the Keyestudio 8833 motor Shield is stacked on the Keyestudio 4.0 development board.

The pin G, V and S of the LED module are connected to G, 5V and D9 of the expansion board respectively.

**5.Test Code**

```c 
//****************************************************************************
/*

Blink
http://www.keyestudio.com
*/
void setup()
{ 
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);// initialize digital pin 9 as an output.
}
    
void loop() // the loop function runs over and over again forever
{  
  digitalWrite(9, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
   delay(1000); // wait for a second
   digitalWrite(9, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
   delay(1000); // wait for a second
}
//****************************************************************************
```

**6.Test Result**

After successfully uploading the code to the V4.0 board, connect the wirings according to the wiring diagram, and use a USB cable to connect the computer to power the board. After powering on, you will see the LED connected to the D9 will be on and off. 

**7.Code Explanation**

pinMode(9，OUTPUT) - This function can denote that the pin is INPUT or OUTPUT

digitalWrite(9，HIGH) - When pin is OUTPUT, we can set it to HIGH(output 5V) or LOW(output 0V)

**8.Extension Practice**

We have succeeded in blinking LED. Next, let’s observe what will happen to the LED if we modify the delay time.

```c
//****************************************************************************

*/
void setup()
{  
  // initialize digital pin 11 as an output.
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
}
// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop()
{ 
  digitalWrite(9, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(100); // wait for 0.1 second
  digitalWrite(9, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(100); // wait for 0.1 second
}
//*****************************************************************
```

The test result shows that the LED flashes faster. Therefore, the delaying time enables to affect the flash frequency of the LED.

### Project 2: Adjust LED Brightness

**1.Description**

In previous lesson, we control LED on and off and make it blink.

In this project, we will control LED’s brightness through PWM simulating breathing effect.

PWM is a means of controlling the analog output via digital means. Digital control is used to generate square waves with different duty cycles (a signal that constantly switches between high and low levels) to control the analog output. In general, the input voltages of ports are 0V and 5V.

What if the 3V is required? Or a switch among 1V, 3V and 3.5V? We cannot change resistors constantly. For this reason, we resort to PWM.

![bbcfcb9ae56abb7e80ee587246fc4be9](media/9.gif)

For the Arduino digital port voltage output, there are only LOW and HIGH, which correspond to the voltage output of 0V and 5V. You can define LOW as 0 and HIGH as 1, and let the Arduino output five hundred 0 or 1 signals within 1s.

If all of the output five hundred are 1, that is 5V; if all of which are 0, that is 0V. If output 010101010101 in this way then the output port is 2.5V, which is like showing movie. The movie we watch are not completely continuous. It actually outputs 25 pictures per second. In this case, the human can’t see it, neither does PWM. If we want different voltage, we need to control the ratio of 0 and 1. The more 0,1 signals output per unit time, the more accurate the control.

PWM is a technology that uses digital methods to obtain analog quantities. Digital control enables to form a square wave, the square wave signal only has on and off two states (high and low).  A voltage ranging from 0 to 5V can be simulated by controlling the ratio of on to off duration.  The time spent on (technically called high level) is called pulse width, so PWM is also called pulse width modulation. 

The green vertical bars represent one period of the square wave.  The value written in each analogWrite(value) corresponds to a percentage, which is also called Duty Cycle. This percentage refers to the ratio of time occupied by the high level in a cycle, that is, duty cycle = high level time/cycle time. 

 In the figure, from top to bottom, the duty cycle of the first square wave is 0%, and the corresponding value is 0, and the LED brightness is the lowest, that is, off state.  The longer the high level lasts, the brighter it will be.  Therefore, the value of the last duty cycle of 100% is 255, and the LED is the brightest.  50% is the brightest half, and 25% is darker.  

PWM is more used to adjust the brightness of LED lights or the rotation speed of the motors, and the wheels speed driven by the motors can be easily controlled. When playing with some Arduino robots, the benefits of PWM can be better reflected.

**3.Wiring Diagram** 

Keep the wiring-up unchanged.

![image-20250508161123490](media/8.png)

**4.Test Code**

```c
//*****************************************************************
/*

 http://www.keyestudio.com
*/
int ledPin = 9; // Define the LED pin at D9
int value;

void setup () {
  pinMode (ledPin, OUTPUT); // initialize ledpin as an output.
}

void loop () {
  for (value = 0; value <255; value = value + 1) 
  {
    analogWrite (ledPin, value); // LED lights gradually light up
    delay (5); // delay 5ms
  }
  for (value = 255; value> 0; value = value-1) 
  {
    analogWrite (ledPin, value); // LED gradually goes out
    delay (5); // delay 5ms
  }
}
//*****************************************************************
```

**5.Test Result**

After successfully uploading the code to the V4.0 board, connect the wirings according to the wiring diagram, and use a USB cable to connect the computer to power the board. After powering on, you will see that the LED gradually changes from bright to dark, like human’s breath, rather than turning on and off immediately.

**6.Code Explanation**

If we need to repeat a certain statement, we could use for statement.

For statement format is shown below:

![image-20250508162458776](media/10.png)

FOR cyclic sequence:

Round 1：1 → 2 → 3 → 4

Round 2：2 → 3 → 4

…

Until number 2 is not established, “for”loop is over,

After knowing this order, go back to code:

**for (int value = 0; value \< 255; value=value+1)**

**for (int value = 255; value \>0; value=value-1)**

The two“for”statements make value increase from 0 to 255, then reduce from 255 to 0, then increase to 255....infinitely loop.

There is a new function in the following ----- analogWrite().

We know that digital port only has two state of 0 and 1. So how to send an analog value to a digital value? Here, this function is needed. Let’s observe the Arduino board and find 6 pins marked“\~”which can output PWM signals.

Function format as follows:

**analogWrite(pin,value)**

analogWrite() is used to write an analog value from 0\~255 for PWM port, so the value is in the range of 0\~255. Attention that you can only write the digital pins with PWM function, such as pin 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11.

PWM is a technology to obtain analog quantity through digital method. Digital control forms a square wave, and the square wave signal only has two states of turning on and off (that is, high or low levels). By controlling the ratio of the duration of turning on and off, a voltage varying from 0 to 5V can be simulated. The time turning on(academically referred to as high level) is called pulse width, so PWM is also called pulse width modulation.

Through the following five square waves, let’s learn more about the PWM.

![image-20250508162529349](media/11.png)

In the above figure, the green line represents a period, and the value of analogWrite() corresponds to a percentage which is called Duty Cycle as well. Duty cycle implies the ratio of time occupied by the high level in the cycle. From top to bottom, the duty cycle of first square wave is 0% and its corresponding value is 0.

The LED brightness is lowest, that is, light off. The more time the high level lasts, the brighter the LED. Therefore, the last duty cycle is 100%, which corresponds to 255, and LED is the brightest. And 50% is the brightest half, 25% means darker.

PWM is more used for adjusting the LED’s brightness or the rotation speed of motors.

It plays a vital role in controlling smart robot cars. I believe that you cannot wait to learn the next project.

**7.Extension Practice**

Let’s modify the value of delay and remain the pin unchanged, then observe how the LED changes.

```c
//***********************************************************
/*
 keyestudio 4wd BT Car
 lesson 2.2
 pwm
 http://www.keyestudio.com
*/
int ledPin = 9; // Define the LED pin at D9
void setup () {
   pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // initialize ledpin as an output.
}

void loop () {
   for (int value = 0; value <255; value = value + 1) {
     analogWrite (ledPin, value); // LED lights gradually light up
     delay (30); // delay 30MS
   }
   for (int value = 255; value> 0; value = value-1) {
     analogWrite (ledPin, value); // LED gradually goes out
     delay (30); // delay 30MS
   }
}
//***********************************************************
```

Upload the code to the development board, then the LED will blink more slowly.

### Project 3: Line Tracking Sensor

![](media/12.png)

**1.Description** 

The tracking sensor is actually an infrared sensor. The component used here is the TCRT5000 infrared tube. Its working principle is to use different reflectivity of infrared light to colors, then convert the strength of the reflected signal into a current signal.

During the process of detection, black is active at HIGH level while white is active at LOW level. The detection height is 0-3 cm.

Keyestudio 3-channel line tracking module has integrated 3 sets of TCRT5000 infrared tubes on a board, which is more convenient for wiring and control.

By rotating the adjustable potentiometer on the sensor, it can adjust the detection sensitivity of the sensor.

**2.Specification**

- Operating Voltage: 3.3-5V (DC)

- Interface: 5PIN

- Output Signal: Digital signal

- Detection Height: 0-3 cm

![image-20250508163247479](media/13.png)

<span style="color: rgb(255, 76, 65);">Note:Before testing, rotate the potentiometer on the sensor to adjust the detection sensitivity. The sensitivity is best when adjusting the LED to a threshold between ON and OFF. </span>

### Project 4 Servo Control

**1.Description**

![image-20250509084654137](media/20.png)

Servo motor is a position control rotary actuator. It mainly consists of a housing, a circuit board, a core-less motor, a gear and a position sensor. Its working principle is that the servo receives the signal sent by MCUs or receivers and produces a reference signal with a period of 20ms and width of 1.5ms, then compares the acquired DC bias voltage to the voltage of the potentiometer and obtain the voltage difference output.

![image-20250509084710719](media/21.png)

In general, servo has three lines in brown, red and orange. The brown wire is grounded, the red one is a positive pole line and the orange one is a signal line.

The rotation angle of servo motor is controlled by regulating the duty cycle of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) signal. The standard cycle of PWM signal is 20ms (50Hz). Theoretically, the width is distributed between 1ms-2ms, but in fact, it's between 0.5ms-2.5ms. The width corresponds the rotation angle from 0° to 180°. But note that for different brand motors, the same signal may have different rotation angles. 

![image-20250509084727797](media/22.png)

The corresponding servo angles are shown below:

![image-20250509084739380](media/23.png)

**2.Specification**

- Working voltage: DC 4.8V \~ 6V

- Operating angle range: about 180 ° (at 500 → 2500 μsec)

- Pulse width range: 500 → 2500 μsec

- No-load speed: 0.12 ± 0.01 sec / 60 (DC 4.8V) 0.1 ± 0.01 sec / 60(DC 6V)

- No-load current: 200 ± 20mA (DC 4.8V) 220 ± 20mA (DC 6V)

- Stopping torque: 1.3 ± 0.01kg · cm (DC 4.8V) 1.5 ± 0.1kg · cm (DC6V)

- Stop current: ≦ 850mA (DC 4.8V) ≦ 1000mA (DC 6V)

**4.Wiring Diagram**

![image-20250509085038006](media/26.png)

Wiring note: The servo is connected to G（GND）、V（VCC）and A3, the brown line of servo is linked with Gnd(G), the red one is connected to 5v(V) and the orange one is attached to A3.

The servo is obliged to connect to the external power due to its high demand for driving servo current. Generally, the current of development board is not big enough. If without connecting the external power, the development board could be burnt.

**5.Test Code**

```c

}

void loop() {
  for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) { // goes from 0 degrees to 180 degrees
    // in steps of 1 degree
    procedure(pos);              // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    delay(15);                   //control the rotation speed of servo
  }
  for (pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) { // goes from 180 degrees to 0 degrees
    procedure(pos);              // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    delay(15);                    
  }
}
  
//function to control servo
void procedure(int myangle) {
  pulsewidth = myangle * 11 + 500;  //calculate the value of pulse width
  digitalWrite(servoPin,HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(pulsewidth);   //The duration of high level is pulse width
  digitalWrite(servoPin,LOW);
  delay((20 - pulsewidth / 1000));  //the cycle is 20ms, the low level last for the rest of time
}
//****************************************************************************
```

**6.Test Result**

After successfully uploading the code to the V4.0 board, connect the wirings according to the wiring diagram, and power on the external power. After powering on, turn the dip switch to the "ON" end, then servo will swing in the range of 0° to 180°.

**7.Extension Practice**

What’s more, we empower to control the servo via library file. Please refer to the link:[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Servo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Servo).

After successfully uploading the code to the V4.0 board, connect the wirings according to the wiring diagram, and power on the external power. After powering on, turn the dip switch to the "ON" end, then servo will swing in the range of 0° to 180° too. We usually control it by library file.

**8.Code Explanation**

Arduino comes with **\#include \<Servo.h\>** (servo function and statement）

The following are some common statements of the servo function:

1). **attach（interface）**——Set interface of the servo

2). **write（angle）**——Used to set rotation angle of servo, and the set angle range is from 0° to 180°

3). **read（）**——used to read angle of servo, namely, reading the command value of“write()”

4). **attached（）**——Judge if the parameter of servo is sent to its interface

<span style="color: rgb(255, 76, 65);">Note:</span> The above written format is“servo variable name, specific statement（）”, for instance: myservo.attach(9).

**4.Working Principle**

As the above picture shown, it is like two eyes. One is transmitting end, the other is receiving end.

The ultrasonic module will emit the ultrasonic waves after triggering a signal. When the ultrasonic waves encounter the object and are reflected back, the module outputs an echo signal, so it can determine the distance of the object from the time difference between the trigger signal and the echo signal.

The t is the time that emitting signal meets obstacle and returns. And the propagation speed of sound in the air is about 343m/s, and distance = speed \* time. However, the ultrasonic wave emits and comes back, which is 2 times of distance. Therefore, it needs to be divided by 2, the distance measured by ultrasonic wave = (speed \* time)/2.

**Use method and chart of ultrasonic module:**

1. Use the GPIO pin to give a high level signal of at least 10μs to the Trig pin of SR04, which can trigger it to detect distance.
2. After triggering, the module will automatically send eight 40KHz ultrasonic pulses and detect whether there is a signal return. This step will be completed automatically by the module.
3. If the signal returns, the Echo pin will output a high level, and the duration of the high level is the time from the transmission of the ultrasonic wave to the return.

**Circuit diagram of ultrasonic sensor:**

**5.Wiring Diagram**

![image-20250509154107103](media/34.png)

VCC, Trig, Echo and Gnd of the ultrasonic sensor are connected to 5V(V), D12, D13 and Gnd(G)

  Serial.print("in, ");
  Serial.print(cm);
  Serial.print("cm");
  Serial.println();
  delay(250);
}
//***************************************************************************
```

**7.Test Result**

After successfully uploading the code to the V4.0 board, connect the wirings according to the wiring diagram, then connect the computer via a USB cable to power the board. After powering on, open the serial monitor and set baud rate to 9600.

The detected distance will be displayed, and the unit is cm and inch. Hinder the ultrasonic sensor by hand, the displayed distance value gets smaller.

![image-20250509154147537](media/35.png)

**8.Code Explanation**

**int trigPin-** this pin is defined to transmit ultrasonic waves,generally output.

**int echoPin -** this is defined as the pin of reception, generally input.

**cm = (duration/2) / 29.1-**

**inches = (duration/2) / 74-**

We can calculate the distance by using the following formula:

distance = (traveltime/2) x speed of sound

The speed of sound is: 343m/s = 0.0343 cm/us = 1/29.1 cm/us

Or in inches: 13503.9in/s = 0.0135in/us = 1/74in/us

We need to divide the traveltime by 2 for we have to take into account that the wave was sent, hit the object, and then returned back to the sensor.

**9.Extension Practice**

We have just measured the distance displayed by the ultrasonic. How about controlling the LED with the measured distance? Let's try it and connect an LED light module to the D9 pin.

After successfully uploading the code to the V4.0 board, connect the wirings according to the wiring diagram, then connect the computer via a USB cable to power the board. After powering on, block the ultrasonic sensor by hand(the distance is between 2-10cm), then check if the LED is on.

### Project 6 IR Reception

![9681c7da-a7c9-49ed-ad8c-32e00c6aeb07](media/37.png)

**1.Description** 

There is no doubt that infrared remote control is ubiquitous in daily life. It is used to control various household appliances, such as TVs, stereos, video recorders and satellite signal receivers. Infrared remote control is composed of infrared transmitting and infrared receiving systems, that is, an infrared remote control and infrared receiving module and a single-chip microcomputer capable of decoding.  

![image-20250509154423060](media/38.png)

The 38K infrared carrier signal emitted by remote controller is encoded by the encoding chip in the remote controller. It is composed of a section of pilot code, user code, user inverse code, data code, and data inverse code. The time interval of the pulse is used to distinguish whether it is 0 or 1 signal and the encoding is made up of these 0, 1 signals.

The user code of the same remote control is constant while the data code can distinguish the key.

When the remote control button is pressed, the remote control sends out an infrared carrier signal. When the IR receiver receives the signal, the program will decode the carrier signal and determines which key is pressed. The MCU decodes the received 01 signal, thereby judging what key is pressed by the remote control.

Infrared receiver we use is an infrared receiver module. Mainly composed of an infrared receiver head, which is a device that integrates reception, amplification, and demodulation. Its internal IC has completed demodulation, and can achieve from infrared reception to output and be compatible with TTL signals.

Additionally, it is suitable for infrared remote control and infrared data transmission. The infrared receiving module made by the receiver has only three pins, signal line, VCC and GND. It is very convenient to communicate with Arduino and other microcontrollers.

**2.Specification**

- Operating Voltage: 3.3-5V（DC)

- Output Signal: Digital signal

- Receiving Angle: 90 degrees

- Frequency: 38khz

- Receiving Distance: 10m

The picture shows the real product and circuit diagram of the infrared receiver.

void setup()  
{  
  Serial.begin(9600);  
  irrecv.enableIRIn(); // Enable receiver 
}  
  
 void loop() {  
  if (irrecv.decode(&results))//decode successfully, receive a set of infrared signals  
   {  
     Serial.println(results.value, HEX);//Wrap word in 16 HEX to output and receive code 
     irrecv.resume(); // Receive the next value
   }  
   delay(100);  
 } 
//*************************************************************************************
```

**5.Test Result**

After successfully uploading the code to the V4.0 board, connect the wirings according to the wiring diagram, then connect the computer via a USB cable to power the board. After powering on, open the serial monitor and set baud rate to 9600.

Take out the remote control, and send signal to the infrared receiver sensor. You can see the key value of the corresponding key, if the key time is too long, FFFFFFFF is prone to garbled characters.

![image-20250510082931375](media/40.png)

The keys value of Keyestudio remote control are shown below.

![image-20250510082942450](media/41.png)

**6.Code Explanation**

**irrecv.enableIRIn():** After enabling IR decoding, the IR signals will be received,

**decode():** The function“decode()”will check continuously to make sure if decoding successfully.

**irrecv.decode(\&results):** after decoding successfully, this function will come back to “true”, and keep result in “results”. After decoding the IR signals, run the resume()function and continue to receive the next signal.

**7.Extension Practice**

We have decoded the key value of the IR remote control. How about controlling LED by the measured value? We could design an experiment.

Attach an LED to D9, then press the keys of remote control to make LED light on and off.

**9.Code Explanation**

**Serial.available()** : Return the number of characters currently remaining in the serial port buffer. Generally, this function is used to judge whether there is data in the buffer of the serial port. When Serial.available()\>0, it means that the serial port has received data and can be read;

**Serial.read() :** Refers to taking out and reading a Byte of data from the serial port buffer. For example, if a device sends data to Arduino through the serial port, we can use Serial.read() to read the sent data.

**10.Extension Practice**

Here we look to use the command sent by the mobile phone to turn on or off an LED light. Looking at the wiring diagram, an LED is connected to the D9 pin.

### Project 8 Motor Driving and Speed Control

![image-20250510090044895](media/72.png)

**1.Description**

There are many ways to drive motors. Our car uses the most commonly used DRV8833 motor driver chip, which provides a two-channel bridge electric drive solution for toys, printers and other integrated motor applications.

When we stack the Shield on the 4.0 development board and power on the BAT, then set the DIP switch to the ON end, the external power supply will power on the two boards at the same time. To facilitate wiring connections, the Shield comes with an anti-reverse port (PH2.0-2P-3P-4P-5P). You can connect the motors, power supply, and sensor modules directly to the Shield. 

The Bluetooth interface of the Shield is fully compatible with the DX-BT24 5.1 Bluetooth module. When connecting the Bluetooth module, you solely need to plug it into the corresponding interface.  At the same time, 2.54 row pins are used to draw out some unused digital and analog ports on the Shield, making it accessible for you to add other sensors and carry out extension experiments. 

The expansion board can be connected to four DC motors. When the jumper cap is connected by default, the motors of ports A and A1 and B and B1 are connected in parallel and have the same motion law.  8 jumper caps can be used to control the rotation direction of the 4 motor interfaces.

For example, when the 2 jumper caps in front of B1 of the M1 motor change from transverse connection to longitudinal connection, the rotation direction of M1 motor will be opposite to the original rotation direction. 

**2.Specification**

- Input voltage for logic：DC 5V

- Input voltage for driving：DC 6-9 V

- Working current for logic：\<36mA

- Working current for driving：\<2A

- Maximum power dissipation：25W（T=75℃）

- Input level for control signal： high level is 2.3V\<Vin\<5V ，low level is -0.3V\<Vin\<1.5V

- Working temperature：-25＋130℃

**Keyestudio 8833 motor driver expansion board**

![image-20250510090404192](media/73.png)

**3.Working Principle**

We use the same side parallel connection mode for the four motors, which can be regarded as two groups of motors.  As shown in the wiring diagram, B and B1 are a group, and A and A1 are a group.

The motors in the same group should rotate in the same direction. If they are different, please adjust the corresponding jumper caps next to the terminal to change the direction.  

As shown below, if the directions of A and A1 are different, adjust the direction of jumper caps until the motor movement direction of the same group is consistent. 

![image-20250510090532851](media/74.png)

From the above diagram, it is known that the direction pin of A motor is D4, the speed pin is D6; D2 is the direction pin of B motor; and D6 is speed pin.

<span style="color:red;">PWM drives the robot car. The PWM value is in the range of 0-255. When we set the direction to HIGH, the smaller the PWM number, the faster the rotation of the motor.</span>

### Project 9 Facial Expression LED Board

![image-20250510090912741](media/82.png)

**1.Description**

How fun it is if a expression board is added to the robot. And the Keyestudio 8\*16 LED board can do the trick. With the help of it, you could design facial expressions, images, patterns and other displays by yourselves.

The 8\*16 LED board comes with 128 LEDs. The data of the microprocessor(Arduino) communicates with the AiP1640 through a two-wire bus interface. Therefore, it can control the on and off of 128 LEDs on the module, so as to make the dot matrix on the module to display the pattern you need. A HX-2.54 4Pin cable is provided for your convenience of wiring.

**2.Specification**

- Working voltage: DC 3.3-5V

- Power loss: 400mW

- Oscillation frequency: 450KHz

- Drive current: 200mA

- Working temperature: -40\~80℃

- Communication mode: I2C

**3.Circuit Diagram**

![image-20250510091309725](media/83.png)

**4.Working Principle**

How to control each LED of the 8\*16 dot matrix? It is known that each byte has 8 bits and each bit is 0 or 1. when it is 0, LED is off while when it is 1 LED is on. One byte can control one column of the LED,and naturally 16 bytes can control 16 columns of LEDs, that’s the 8\*16 dot matrix.

**5.Pins description and communication protocol**

The data of the microprocessor (Arduino) communicates with the AiP1640 through a two-wire bus cable.

The communication protocol diagram is as follows (SCLK) is SCL, (DIN) is SDA.

![image-20250510091407219](media/84.png)

①The starting condition for data input: SCL is high level and SDA changes from high to low.

②For data command setting, there are methods as shown in the figure below.

In our sample program, select the way to **add 1 to the address automatically**, the binary value is 0100 0000 and the corresponding hexadecimal value is 0x40.

![Img](media/85.png)

③For address command setting, the address can be selected as shown below.

The first 00H is selected in our sample program, and the binary number 1100 0000 corresponds to the hexadecimal 0xc0.

![Img](media/86.png)

④The requirement for data input is that when SCL is at high level when inputting data, the signal on SDA must remain unchanged. Only when the clock signal on SCL is at low level, can the signal on SDA be changed. The input of data is the low bit first, and the high bit later.

⑤The condition for the end of data transmission is that when SCL is at low level, SDA at low level and SCL at high level, the level of SDA becomes high.

⑥Display control, set different pulse width, pulse width can be selected as shown in the figure below.

In the example, the pulse width is 4/16, and the hexadecimal corresponding to 1000 1010 is 0x8A.

![Img](media/87.png)

**Instructions for the use of modulus tool**

The dot matrix tool uses the online version, and the link is :[http://dotmatrixtool.com/\#](http://dotmatrixtool.com/\#)

①Enter the link and the page appears as shown below

![image-20250510091438524](media/88.png)

②The dot matrix is 8\*16, so adjust the height to 8 and width to 16, as shown in the figure below.

![image-20250510091446519](media/89.png)

③Generate hexadecimal data from the pattern

### Project 10 Restricting Smart Car

![644a1976bf17a6b64e0aed1a7240ff1e](media/103.jpeg)

**1.Description**

In this project, we look to combine the knowledge of a line tracking sensor and motor driver modules to make a restricting smart car.  In the experiment, we aim to use the line tracking sensor to detect whether there is a black line around the smart car, and then control the rotation of the two motors according to the detection results in a way that lock the smart car in a circle drawn in black line.

**2.Flow Chart**
